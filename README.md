# Snarveg — MIX301 Project 
### (Media and Interaction Design, UiB)

Team:
Oline Kleiven – Developer
Ole Gåsvær– Researcher
Sol Hansen Berg – UX Designer


We are a small interdisciplinary team exploring AI-assisted design and development workflows in our master’s course MIX301 – Media Technology: Theory and Development at the University of Bergen.
Our project, Snarveg, investigates how AI tools can support rapid prototyping, iteration, and collaboration across design, research, and development. The goal is to create an intuitive travel app that makes it easier to get from A to B in Bergen — faster, simpler, and with better UX.
This project combines user-centered design, AI-driven prototyping, and vibe coding methods to explore how emerging technologies can shape the future of mobility and interaction design.

## How to work with Git (for you, my team members)

### When you want to make changes:

1. **First, check what's changed:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Add your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Save your changes with a message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
   ```

4. **Upload to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

5. **Always pull before starting new work:**
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

### Important notes:
- Always run `git pull` before starting new work to get the latest changes
- Write clear commit messages describing what you changed
- If you get errors, ask for help - don't worry!
