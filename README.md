We are a small interdisciplinary team exploring AI-assisted design and development workflows in the master's course MIX301 – Media Technology: Theory and Development at the University of Bergen. Our project, Snarveg, explores how AI tools can improve rapid prototyping, iteration and collaboration across design, research and development. The goal is to create an intuitive travel app that helps people get from A to B in Bergen – faster, easier and with a better user experience. By combining user-centered design, AI-driven prototyping and vibe coding methods, Snarveg explores how new technologies can shape the future of mobility and interaction design.

  # Snarveg_Sketch

  This is a code bundle for Snarveg_Sketch. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/4b1wKcp06Mi6nvFUCNv0Ni/Snarveg_Sketch.

  ## Running the code
   Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

   Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

   ### macOS / zsh quick-start

   If you see "command not found: npm" (common on a fresh macOS setup), install Node.js first. We recommend using a Nodgit e version manager such as `volta` or `nvm`.

   - Install Volta (recommended):

      curl https://get.volta.sh | bash

      After installing Volta, install Node 18 (recommended):

      volta install node@18

   - Or install nvm and Node 18:

      curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
      # then in a new terminal:
      nvm install 18

   Once Node and npm are available, run:

   npm i
   npm run dev

   If the dev server opens on a different port, Vite will print the local URL in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).
