## How to work with Git (for you, my team members)

### When you want to make changes:

1. **First, check what's changed:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Add your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Save your changes with a message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
   ```

4. **Upload to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

5. **Always pull before starting new work:**
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

### Important notes:
- Always run `git pull` before starting new work to get the latest changes
- Write clear commit messages describing what you changed
- If you get errors, ask for help - don't worry!
